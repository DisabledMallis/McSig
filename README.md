# McSig
A signature & class info database for Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition


# Contributing
* The "sigdb.json" is a json file containing all of the signatures, as well as information about them.
* To add a new function, simply follow the format and provide the information.
* If some information cannot be provided, (such as a signature format you don't use) simply leave it as 'null'. 
* Don't forget to credit yourself! There is a field for an author in each section. Write a name or discord, or really any way you want to credit youself (given its not long or annoying). If you're modifying an existing function to correct data, simply add a comma after any previous authors and then write your name. Ex. "One person, Another, You"
